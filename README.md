Helloe Hello Hello Branch Modified file 



- 'git init': Initialize a respostory (Only type this once, do not 'nest' your repositories
- 'git status': Tells us whats going on 

*this* is an italic and **this** is old
This is just a test to see whether editing the file gets saved
- 'git' comment message 

If we want o create a new branch to retain commites you create, you may do so by using -b with the chackout command
eg) git checkout -b <new-branch-name>
